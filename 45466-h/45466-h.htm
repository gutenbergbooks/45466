<h3>AFTERNOON</h3>
<hr class="tb" />


<p style="margin-left: 25%;">
<a id="I"></a>I<br />
<br />
<br />
Slowly maturity has come to our surprise,<br />
Placing its hands upon the naked forehead of our love,<br />
Looking upon it with its dimmer eyes.<br />
<br />
And, in the garden shrivelled by July,<br />
The flowers and shrubs and vibrant leaves<br />
Have let fall their fervent powers which lie<br />
Over the misty pond and gentle paths.<br />
And bitterly the jealous sun now shows<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Harshly a brilliant shadow</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Round its light that grieves.</span><br />
<br />
And yet, see how the fearless hollyhocks aspire<br />
Ardently to their own splendid fire!<br />
See how season after season's stress<br />
Is vain&mdash;the fibres of our hearts<br />
Deeper than ever and insatiable,<br />
Are rooted firmly in our happiness.<br />
<br />
Oh hours of afternoon, fragrant with rose,<br />
Clutching at time, with cheek in flower and flame,<br />
Seeking, against his chilly side, repose!<br />
<br />
And nothing, nothing is better than to feel<br />
Happy and limpid still&mdash;after what years?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But if fate had willed above</span><br />
For us two naught but suffering and tears,<br />
Still, would I have wished to live and die<br />
Complaintless, in such unrelenting love!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="II"></a>II<br />
<br />
<br />
Roses of June, you the most fair,<br />
You with your hearts transpierced by sun;<br />
Violent, tranquil roses, with the air<br />
Of halted flights of birds upon a bough;<br />
Roses of June and July, straight and new-begun,<br />
Mouths whose kisses all at once are thrilled<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With the wind or with it stilled,</span><br />
Caressing with shade and gold the moving green;<br />
Roses mutely ardent and sweet willed,<br />
Voluptuous roses in your sheaths of moss,<br />
You who pass the long summer time<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Loving each other</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In this clarity sublime;</span><br />
Fresh, magnificent, vivid&mdash;like you, oh roses,<br />
Is our multitudinous desire<br />
That in lassitude or leaping fire<br />
Loves, exalts, and then reposes!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="III"></a>III<br />
<br />
<br />
If other flowers decorate our home,<br />
And multiply the splendour of this place,<br />
The little lake shines ever from the grass<br />
With the large eyes of its ever moving face.<br />
<br />
Ah, say, from what deep distances unknown<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So many gleaming birds have come</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With wings sun-sown?</span><br />
<br />
July has driven April from the close<br />
And bluish tints have given place to red,<br />
The skies are torpid and the wind has fled;<br />
Joyously brilliant insects fill the air<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That harks,</span><br />
And summer wanders by, robed with diamonds<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And sparks.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="IV"></a>IV<br />
<br />
<br />
Shadows are lustral in the iris'd dawn;<br />
From a branch on high whence a bird has fled<br />
Dew drops tremble and are gone.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Purity, delicate and fair,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beautifies the hour that brings</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Crystal brilliance to the air;</span><br />
We hear the sounds of water and the brush of wings.<br />
<br />
Oh! how your eyes are beauteous at this hour<br />
When our silver lake is gleaming in the sight<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the day arising;</span><br />
Your forehead radiant and your heart-beat light.<br />
Intensity of life, its goodness and its power,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like to a mighty blessedness</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of your soul are part,</span><br />
So that to contain the anguish and the stress,<br />
Suddenly your hands have clasped my own,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Laying them, as though with fear,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Against your heart.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="V"></a>V<br />
<br />
<br />
I bring you, this eve, an offering of joy<br />
From having drenched my body in the gold<br />
And silken texture of the joyous wind<br />
And in the yellow splendour of the sun;<br />
My feet are pure with having walked the grass,<br />
My hands are sweet with the dim hearts of flowers,<br />
My eyes are brilliant with the sudden tears<br />
Born in an instant from the sight of such<br />
A beauteous earth and its eternal night.<br />
<br />
Space, with arms of burning clarity,<br />
Drunk and fervent, sobbing, led me on,<br />
And I have gone down there&mdash;I know not where&mdash;<br />
Where all my captive cries did free my steps;<br />
I bring you life and beauty of the plains;<br />
Take from me their free and bounteous breath;<br />
Storms have laid caresses on my hands,<br />
And air and light and perfume are in me.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="VI"></a>VI<br />
<br />
<br />
Come, let us rest a while beside the path,<br />
Upon the aged bench long stained with mould,<br />
And let me leave, between your two sure hands,<br />
My hand, abandoned to your gentle hold.<br />
<br />
And as my hand that lies upon your knees<br />
Is glad to be abandoned there and knows<br />
Contentment, so my sweet and fervent heart<br />
Between your gentle hands has found repose.<br />
<br />
And there is joy intense and love profound<br />
Of which we do partake together now,<br />
Nor trembles on our lips a single word<br />
Too strong, nor any kiss that burns your brow.<br />
<br />
We would prolong the ardour of this silence,<br />
Of mute desires the immobility,<br />
Save that, when they quiver of a sudden,<br />
I press your pensive hands unknowingly&mdash;<br />
<br />
Your hands wherein my happiness is sealed&mdash;<br />
Your hands which never would attempt to reach<br />
To all these sacred and profounder things<br />
Whereby we live without the need of speech.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="VII"></a>VII<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sweetly and more sweetly still</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Cradle in your arms my head,</span><br />
My fevered eyes and forehead wearied;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sweetly and more sweetly still</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Kiss my lips and say</span><br />
Words made sweeter at each break of day<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When uttered by your voice:</span><br />
That you are given to me and that I love you still.<br />
<br />
The day has broken dull and sad; my sleep<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was swept with sombre dreams;</span><br />
The rain lets down its dusky hair in streams,<br />
And skies are lost in dreary clouds that weep.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sweetly and more sweetly still</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Cradle in your arms my head,</span><br />
My fevered eyes and forehead wearied;<br />
You are to me the gracious morn<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose caress is in your hand:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Behold, I am reborn,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With no evil or dismay,</span><br />
Unto the daily work which marks my way,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">&mdash;A sign</span><br />
That makes me live in an heroic strife,<br />
A sword of beauty and of power divine<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Against invidious life.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="VIII"></a>VIII<br />
<br />
<br />
Within the house our love has chosen for its birth,<br />
With its familiar things that people coign and shade,<br />
Where we two live alone with only witnesses<br />
The roses gazing through the window from the glade;<br />
<br />
There are some days so filled with reassuring peace,<br />
Hours of the radiant summer with silence made so fair,<br />
I sometimes bring to stillness the balancing of time<br />
Within the great oak clock that stands close by the stair.<br />
<br />
Then is the hour, the day, the night so part of us<br />
That happiness which breathes upon us hears no thing<br />
Except the ardent throbbing of your heart and mine<br />
When quick embraces heart to yearning heart do bring.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="IX"></a>IX<br />
<br />
<br />
My pleasant work by open windows wide,<br />
With shadow of green leafage from out-side<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And path of the sun's light</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Across my paper white,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Maintains a gentle violence,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">A sense</span><br />
Of silence in our kindly, pensive house.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Vividly the flowers lean,</span><br />
And glowing fruits among the boughs are seen,<br />
Birds on boughs and birds upon the wing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">Chant and sing</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In order that my verse may ring</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Clear and new, pure and trues</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">As song of birds,</span><br />
And gold of fruits and petals blossoming.<br />
<br />
Down in the garden there I see you pass,<br />
Over the sunny and the shady grass;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But you do not look at me,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Lest you trouble my tranquillity,</span><br />
As here with jealous heart I fashion<br />
Poems of a frank and tender passion.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="X"></a>X<br />
<br />
<br />
All faith lies at the bottom of our love,<br />
Joining an ardent thought to everything:<br />
The faint awakening blossom, or above<br />
Downward the drift of petals from a rose;<br />
The flight of bird on dark or sun-lit wing;<br />
A nest half-falling from a roof that knows<br />
Much of the wind's harsh manner&mdash;here is scope&mdash;<br />
And in the flowery heart where insects cling,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For fear, and all of hope.</span><br />
<br />
What matters it if reason with its snows<br />
Falls chilling on such poignant ecstasy?<br />
Let us accept it with a mind that knows<br />
No false, no true, no evil and no good<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That it may hold prophetically;</span><br />
Let us be happy with our childish eyes,<br />
Be it an evil or triumphant power;<br />
And let us hide from men who are too wise.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XI"></a>XI<br />
<br />
<br />
Dawn, shadow, evening, space and stars; what night<br />
Hides in its veils or shows forth mistily,<br />
Add to their exaltation; they who live<br />
In love, live also in eternity.<br />
<br />
No need that reason light its beacon fires<br />
On walls that rear them high above the ground,<br />
Kindling the docks, the harbour and the sea;<br />
For they beyond all ocean's paths are bound.<br />
<br />
They see the light of dawns touch shore on shore,<br />
Beyond and far beyond the black sea's space;<br />
For certitude and trembling hope themselves,<br />
Meeting their ardent gaze, have the same face.<br />
<br />
Joyous and limpid is their hungry faith;<br />
Their soul is the profound and sudden light<br />
Which burns for them on high and heavenly things;<br />
To know the world, within they turn their sight.<br />
<br />
They go by distant paths and live with truths<br />
That bound the far horizon of their eyes,<br />
Simple and naked, deep, and sweet as dawn;<br />
For them alone are songs of paradise.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XII"></a>XII<br />
<br />
<br />
It is the pleasant hour when lamps are lit;<br />
Calmness and consolation over all;<br />
The silences so deep that one could hear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A feather fall.</span><br />
<br />
It is the hour when the belovèd comes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like to the sweetly soft and low</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wandering mist upon the breeze,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sweetly slow.</span><br />
She speaks no word at first&mdash;and yet I hark,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hark to the soul of her, surprise</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Its gleam and dark,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And then I kiss her eyes.</span><br />
<br />
It is the pleasant hour when lamps are lit,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">The vow</span><br />
To love each other through the live-long day<br />
From depths of heart made luminous by it.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Is with us now.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And then we speak of simple things;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The fruit we gathered in the close,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The flowers that disclose,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Between the verdant mosses thick,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Their almost wings;</span><br />
<br />
And thought does blossom forth once more<br />
At memory of a word so fair<br />
Hid in a just remembered drawer,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a letter of last year.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XIII"></a>XIII<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dead kisses of the long dead years</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Have left their mark upon your face,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beneath the sad, harsh winds of age</span><br />
Of many roses now there is no trace.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I see not now your mouth and eyes</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Gleam, like the birth of morning fair,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor softly now your head repose</span><br />
Within the dark deep garden of your hair.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your dear hands that still are sweet</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Have somehow suffered from the loss</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of light about their finger-tips</span><br />
That touched my forehead, like the dawn-kissed moss.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your body that was fair and young</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That I did with my thoughts endow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No longer now is fresh as dew,</span><br />
Your arm no longer like the white, clean bough.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All falls, alas, and fades away,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All changes now: your voice once smooth,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your body, lowered like a shield</span><br />
To spill the precious victories of youth.<br />
<br />
And yet my heart says still with fervent stress:<br />
What matter that the years grow heavier?<br />
Since I know well that nothing can e'er bound<br />
Or trouble our exalted happiness,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And that our souls are too profound</span><br />
For love to die for want of loveliness.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XIV"></a>XIV<br />
<br />
<br />
It is now fifteen years that we have thought as one;<br />
And that our passion clear has conquered habitude,<br />
Such as is wont to injure the most tenacious love<br />
With unremitting stress of wasteful hands and rude.<br />
<br />
And when I look at you I make discoveries,<br />
Such is the intimacy your pride and sweetness bring;<br />
And time, though it has somewhat obscured your loveliness,<br />
Exalts your heart whose golden depths are opening.<br />
<br />
Naively now you let its hidden depths be searched,<br />
Your soul yet always seems as fresh as kindled fire;<br />
And, like an eager ship with wind-swept masts, our joy<br />
Voyages upon the seas of our desire.<br />
Within ourselves alone we anchor all our faith<br />
To naked frankness and to high benevolence;<br />
And we work and live forever in the light<br />
Of a joyous and translucent confidence.<br />
<br />
You have the strength of frailty and infinite purity<br />
To walk the sombre roadways, your heart in aureole,<br />
And to have cherished dearly in spite of mist or shade,<br />
All the rays of morning in your childlike soul.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XV"></a>XV<br />
<br />
<br />
I thought our joy had been forever dulled<br />
Like sun that fades before the day has fled,<br />
When sickness, to a bed of weariness,<br />
Slowly dragged me with its arms of lead.<br />
<br />
Garden and flow'rs were either feared or false;<br />
The very light of day was a distress;<br />
And my poor hands already were too weak<br />
To hold our trembling, captive, happiness.<br />
<br />
My desires became but evil plants<br />
That scourged like thistles in a windy place;<br />
I felt my heart both frozen and afire,<br />
Then arid, and rebellious unto grace.<br />
<br />
But, nowhere searching save in simple love,<br />
The most consoling word of all you spoke;<br />
And at the glowing fire of your word<br />
I warmed myself until the daylight broke.<br />
<br />
I was not in your eyes, as in my own,<br />
A man belittled by disease and grief;<br />
You plucked me flowers from the window-ledge,<br />
And I believed in health with your belief.<br />
<br />
You brought to me within your garments' folds<br />
The eager air, the wind of field and wood,<br />
Scents of the eve and odours of the dawn,<br />
And sunlight in your kisses fresh and good.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">All that lives about us here,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Beneath a radiance soft and clear,</span><br />
Soft grasses, tender branches, hollyhocks,<br />
The shade that soothes them, the wind that mocks,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The singing birds that one by one</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Join the brilliant swarm,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Like jewel-clusters, warm</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">With sun;</span><br />
All that lives within the garden wall,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Love us ingenuously;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">And we,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">We love them all.</span><br />
<br />
Dear to us the lilies that grow high;<br />
The reaching sunflowers clearer than the sky<br />
&mdash;Circles that bright lambent tongues enroll&mdash;<br />
Burn, with their glowing fervency, our soul.<br />
<br />
The simple flowers, phlox and lilac tall,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Down by the wall,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Are yearning to be near us too,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And the involuntary grass,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">On the lawn when we pass,</span><br />
Opens its moistened eyes that are the dew.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We live with the flowers and the grass,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Simple, pure and ardent still,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Lost in our love,</span><br />
Like single sheaves within the infinite wheat,<br />
And proudly let imperial summer pass<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And from above</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sweep and pierce with clarity</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Body, heart and will.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XVII"></a>XVII<br />
<br />
<br />
With all my heart and brain, my feeling and my seeing,<br />
And with the flaming torch of all my being<br />
That reaches toward your goodness and your love,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Forever unassuaged,</span><br />
I love and bring you thanks and endless praise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">For having come in all simplicity</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Along devoted ways,</span><br />
To take, with gracious hands, my destiny.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And since you leaned above,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">I know&mdash;oh what a love!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Candid and clear as is the dew</span><br />
Fallen upon my tranquil soul from you.<br />
<br />
I am yours as by their nerves of flame<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Fire and fuel merge;.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All my flesh and all my soul</span><br />
Strive to you with undesisting urge;<br />
Nor do I cease from long remembering<br />
The fervency and beauty of our years,<br />
Till suddenly I feel my eyes are filled<br />
Deliciously, with unoblivious tears.<br />
<br />
I come to you happy and resolved<br />
With proud desire to be unto your soul<br />
He who shall be the surest of its joys.<br />
Tenderness folds us in an aureole;<br />
Echoes, within me, at your call assemble;<br />
The hour is holy and with rapture fraught,<br />
And just to touch your brow my fingers tremble,<br />
As though they brushed the pinions of your thought.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XVIII"></a>XVIII<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh days of fresh and quiet healthfulness<br />
When life is filled with beauty without end,<br />
And inspiration comes familiarly,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A cherished friend.</span><br />
<br />
He comes from lands all sweet and glimmering,<br />
And with his words, more fair than dew, has brought,<br />
Wherewith to set, a gem all luminous,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A sentiment, a thought.</span><br />
<br />
He seizes on our being like a storm,<br />
Rears up our spirit to new heights untrod,<br />
Pours down the fire from beating stars, and brings<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The gift of being God.</span><br />
<br />
All fevered transports and profoundest fears<br />
To his own tragic will are ever whirled,<br />
That the pulse of beauty be made young<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the veins of the world.</span><br />
<br />
I am at his mercy, am his ardent prey!<br />
<br />
So, when from weary work I take my way,<br />
Toward the deep repose which is your love,<br />
With all my mind's high leaping fire sublime,<br />
It seems&mdash;oh, for an instant's time&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That I may offer you, oh love,</span><br />
As though of my own pulses it were part,<br />
Of the great universe itself, the beating heart.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XIX"></a>XIX<br />

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I have left the groves of sleep,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sad a little to leave you</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hid beneath their branchy roof</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">From morning sun and dew.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Gleam now phlox and hollyhock;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I look on joyous garden site,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And know that soon the crystal bells</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Will tinkle in the light.</span><br />
<br />
Then suddenly I take my way to you,<br />
With such a tenderness and love that sweep<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Into my midmost being</span><br />
That it seems my thought has travelled through&mdash;<br />
To bring you joy of reawakening&mdash;<br />
All the leafy umbrage of your sleep.<br />
<br />
And when I come to you within the house,<br />
That shade and silence still possess, hear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">My ardent kisses, fresh</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And clear,</span><br />
Sing you a morning song through meadows of the flesh.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

Alas! when the poison of disease<br />
Ran, with my slow and torpid blood,<br />
More sluggish and more torpid day by day,<br />
Ran in my veins a leaden flood;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And my poor eyes</span><br />
Saw my hands so thin and white,<br />
Morosely watched the dreaded course<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the hated blight;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When I had not even force</span><br />
Upon your heart my burning mouth to press<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There to kiss our happiness;</span><br />
When the days, monotonous and sad,<br />
Gnawed my consciousness with spite,<br />
I never could, myself, have found the will<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To rise with stoic might,</span><br />
If you had not poured into my veins<br />
The secret heroism that you have,<br />
Daily, every hour of every week,<br />
With hands so patient, so serene and brave.<br />
<br />
<br />

Within the garden there is healthfulness.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lavishly it gives it us</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In light that cleaves</span><br />
To every movement of its thousand hands<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of palms and leaves.</span><br />
<br />
And the good shade where it accepts,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">After long journeyings,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Our steps,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pours on the weary limb</span><br />
A force of life and sweetness like<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Its mosses dim.</span><br />
<br />
When the lake is playing with the wind and sun,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It seems a crimson heart</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Within, all ardent, has begun</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To throb with the moving wave;</span><br />
The gladiolus and the fervent rose,<br />
Which in their splendour move unshadowèd,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon their vital stems expose</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their cups of gold and red.</span><br />
<br />
Within the garden there is healthfulness.<br />

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It was June in the garden,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It was our time, our day;</span><br />
And our gaze with love on everything<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Did fall;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They seemed then softly opening,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And they saw and loved us both,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">The roses all.</span><br />
<br />
The sky was purer than all limpid thought;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Insect and bird</span><br />
Swept through the golden texture of the air,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Unheard;</span><br />
Our kisses were so fair they brought<br />
Exaltation to both light and bird.<br />
It seemed as though a happiness at once<br />
Had skied itself and wished the heavens entire<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For its resplendent fire;</span><br />
And life, all pulsing life, had entered in,<br />
Into the fissures of our beings to the core,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To fling them higher.</span><br />
<br />
And there was nothing but invocatory cries,<br />
Mad impulses, prayers and vows that cleave<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">The arched skies,</span><br />
And sudden yearning to create new gods,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">In order to believe.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XXIII"></a>XXIII<br />
<br />
<br />
Your gift of self is ever prodigal;<br />
The flight that wings you higher is above,<br />
Above cessation and all weariness,<br />
Reaching toward the heaven of fullest love.<br />
<br />
A clasp of hands, a glance enfevers you;<br />
Your heart appears so beautiful and such<br />
That I do fear your eyes, your lips, and that<br />
I am unworthy and you love too much.<br />
<br />
Alas! the fire and tenderness too high<br />
For beings who have only one poor heart,<br />
Wet with regrets and thorny with its faults,<br />
To find but tears to weep with when they part.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XXIV"></a>XXIV<br />
<br />
<br />
O quiet garden wherein nothing moves<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Save, in the glassy lake,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The crimson fishes, each</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">A fiery flake.</span><br />
<br />
They are the memories that play within our thought,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Calm and undistraught</span><br />
And clear, as in the water's breast<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of confidence and rest.</span><br />
<br />
The red fish leap and the clear water wells,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the abrupt and potent light,</span><br />
Amid the iris green and bleaching shells<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And motionless stones</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Around the border bright.</span><br />
<br />
It is sweet to see them come and go<br />
In all the freshness and lucidity<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That bathes them so;</span><br />
We have no need to fear or fret<br />
Lest they should bring up from below<br />
Other than a fugitive regret.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XXV"></a>XXV<br />
<br />
<br />
As with others, time and change and strife&mdash;<br />
Morose time and moods of hate&mdash;<br />
Have left their sombre scars upon our life;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But never yet our hearts have heard,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Even at close of days unfortunate,</span><br />
The utterance of an unpardonable word.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ardent, luminous sincerity</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was our wisdom and delight,</span><br />
So that our fervid souls in verity<br />
Tempered themselves as in a bath of light.<br />
<br />
We told each other our most humble griefs,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Grief by grief, a rosary,</span><br />
Told each other, weeping tears of love;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And then confidingly,</span><br />
At each avowal, with our lips we pressed<br />
A kiss on every fault confessed.<br />
<br />
Thus simply, without weakness or despair,<br />
We save us from ourselves and worldly harms,<br />
And ward off suffering and gnawing care,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And see our spirits born again;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As reappear when washed by rain,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When sunlight sweetly dries and warms,</span><br />
The purity of glass and gold of window pane.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XXVI"></a>XXVI<br />
<br />
<br />
The golden ships of summer time<br />
That left this morning, mad with space,<br />
Return now from the blood-red west,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sad, with slackened pace.</span><br />
<br />
Over the ocean now they come,<br />
Moved by listless, weary rowers;<br />
They seem like cradles in the sky<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where sleep the autumn flowers.</span><br />
<br />
Lilies, with your faded brows,<br />
You have felt the wind's keen breath;<br />
Only the flaming roses strive<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To live beyond all death.</span><br />
<br />
What matter for their fullest flower<br />
October days or April bright?<br />
They have but simple wish to drink,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Even the sanguine, light;</span><br />
<br />
On sombre days, when under clouds<br />
Haggardly the heavens hide,<br />
They will, for one lone ray of sun,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Exalt at Christmastide.</span><br />
<br />
You, oh spirits, live like them!<br />
They have not pride that lilies feel,<br />
But hold within their folds a sacred<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And immortal zeal.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XXVII"></a>XXVII<br />
<br />
<br />
Fervency of sense, of heart, of soul&mdash;<br />
Vain words created to despoil love's powers;<br />
Sun, you distinguish not between your flames<br />
Of all your evening, dawn, or midday hours.<br />
<br />
You move all blinded by your proper light<br />
Through blazing space, beneath the arched sky,<br />
Knowing alone that your great, ample power<br />
Works at things mysterious and high.<br />
<br />
For love means exaltation's ceaseless deeds;<br />
Oh you whose sweetness sweetens my proud heart,<br />
What need to weigh the pure gold of our dream?<br />
I love you wholly, with my every part.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XXVIII"></a>XXVIII<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The moveless beauty</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the summer evenings,</span><br />
Upon the grass where they deploy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Gives with symbolic offerings,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Gestureless, without a word,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The deep repose of joy.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Morning with its surprises</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Has gone where no wind rises;</span><br />
Midday itself with folds of velvet air<br />
No longer sinks upon the torpid plain;<br />
Now is the hour when the evening once again<br />
Without a moving leaf or ripple on lake breast,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Comes down from lofty hills</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">To our garden where</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">It seeks its rest.</span><br />
<br />
Oh golden splendour of the burnished lake,<br />
And trees and shadows of them on the reeds,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And tranquil sumptuous silences</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">That take</span><br />
Immutably the kingdom of our hearts,<br />
So that within us now a vow we cherish<br />
Of it to live and die and live again,<br />
Like two hearts drunk almost to pain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">With light,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Who cannot perish!</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XXIX"></a>XXIX<br />
<br />
<br />
You spoke that evening words so beautiful<br />
That even the flowers, leaning on the breeze,<br />
Suddenly loved us so that one of them,<br />
To touch us both, fell down upon our knees.<br />
<br />
You spoke of the near time when our two lives,<br />
Like too-ripe fruits, would be upgathered,<br />
And how the tocsin of our fate would knell,<br />
And love be with us still, though youth had fled.<br />
<br />
Your voice was round me like a close embrace,<br />
Your burning heart so quiet and so brave,<br />
I would have seen unfold without a fear<br />
The winding road that leads toward the grave.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XXX"></a>XXX<br />
<br />
<br />
"Sun-lit Hours," "Hours of Afternoon,"<br />
Hours superbly now a part of us!<br />
Your measured pace lights up our garden paths,<br />
Our golden roses kiss you as in pain;<br />
Summer's dying; autumn comes now soon.<br />
<br />
Hours of fragrant flowering, will you come again?<br />
<br />
And yet if Fate, that holds the stars in leash,<br />
Spare us its evil and its bitter chance,<br />
Perhaps you shall weave some day before my eyes<br />
The measured footfalls of your radiant dance;<br />
And I shall add then to your ardent showers<br />
Of shade and sunlight on the grassy slope<br />
&mdash;Like a supreme, immense and sovereign hope&mdash;<br />
The steps and farewells of my "Twilight Hours."<br />
